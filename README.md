# Bank Subscriber Identification

The ability of humans to recognize patterns is one of the key aspects that separates us from machines. It is quite natural that we would seek to design and create machines that could also perform pattern recognition. The applications of such a design is vast ranging from automated speech recognition, fingerprint identification, optical character recognition, DNA sequence identification many more. Here, we present the Bank Marketing Dataset of the University of California, Irvine. Here we will be estimating if a customer will subscribe to the bank or not based on the number of features collected. This is a more practical and real-life pattern classification problem that has huge market implications.
